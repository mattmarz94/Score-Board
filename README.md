# Score-Board

Here is a basketball score-board which involves creating a simple DOM to add score totals for either team in increments of 1, 2, or 3 points.

Creating this application with javaScript helped me build a better understanding calling HTML elements with javaScript in order to manipulate the DOM and create the outcomes I needed.
Also, I reviewed certain CSS properties and it was a great way to refresh my memory.
